# 🚗 NYC Traffic Collision Analysis and Prediction

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing patterns in traffic collisions across New York City (NYC) with the goal of:
- Identifying **high-risk factors** contributing to collisions
- Developing predictive models to anticipate accident hotspots
- Quantifying the **impact of COVID-19** on traffic incidents

By leveraging historical data and statistical modeling, the project aims to provide actionable insights for improving road safety and informing policy decisions.
